# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Handwritten digit recognition is a subfield of pattern recognition and machine learning that involves the identification and classification of handwritten digits. The goal is to create algorithms or models that can accurately determine which digit is represented in a given handwritten image.

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and serves as a fundamental introduction to image classification tasks. It has applications in various domains, including postal automation (for reading addresses on envelopes), bank check processing (for reading handwritten numbers), and digitizing historical documents.

The most well-known dataset used for handwritten digit recognition is the MNIST dataset. MNIST contains a large collection of grayscale images, each representing a single handwritten digit (0 to 9) and labeled with the corresponding digit. Each image is a 28x28-pixel square, and the task is to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify these images into their respective digit classes.
